Code for Schemer Series books
==============

Racket code for exercises from each chapter with relevant notes.

DrRacket provides the interactive environment for running the code and further experimentation.

RackUnit is used for red-green-refactor style workflow - this generates no output for successful tests (green part) and fails for broken tests.

Function definitions required from previous chapters are included and highlighted at the start of the file.

In addition to the exercises from the book, there are some other derivations of Y combinator with explanation notes.
